# Real Estate Sales Analysis (USA, 2001-2022)

## Introduction
This project analyses real estate market dynamics and transaction analysis

## Dataset
- Source: DataGov (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/real-estate-sales-2001-2018)
- Size: 1,097,631
- Description: Price, Assessed Value, Location, Property Types
- Uncleaned Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EVkryRrqJMdU1JCss0som56s0mVujdWC/view?usp=drive_link
- Cleaned Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XmYXoGJyZV7kiN_mEN1j8Fs18qNkuMCs/view?usp=sharing

## Tech Stack  
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **SQL:** SQLite for querying data  
- **Other:** CSV, PrettyTable, Tableau  

## Steps Taken  
- Data Cleaning (importing, handling missing values, standardizing categorical data, correcting data format, binning, binning visualisation)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (trends, transactions)

## Results 
During the exploratory analysis, the insights suggest that there had been a positive trend in price increases from 2001 to 2022. 
In addition, results represent a moderate positive correlation between increasing assessed values and sale amounts. 
Yet, the correlation is not perfect, and other factors could influence the growth in sale prices over time.Â Next, the findings determined that apartments are the most expensive among other property types, while public utilities are the least costly. 
Finally, results identified Greenwich as the most expensive town in the United States. Meanwhile, the highest transactions occurred in Bridgeport, Stamford and Waterbury.

## Next Steps
Further investigations are suggested based on the given exploratory analysis. Examinations can include the cause of high transactions in the top cities and the reason for increasing sale prices. Since the correlation between increasing assessed value and sale amount did not show the perfect positive correlations.

In addition, the limitation for data cleaning exists due to the size of the dataset. The limitation consists of rows with repeating data, while the varying sale amounts are comparatively low compared to one repetitive assessed value. That perhaps implies one assessed value for the entire block with clustered properties. Those properties were sold separately, contributing to separate transactions at different times. Future analysis could include the aggregated data frame for further investigations.
