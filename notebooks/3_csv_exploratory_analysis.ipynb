For instance, in 2005 the property value was lower while in 2006 it was significantly higher. \n# It could suggest that the real estate market experienced some major fluctuations. However, recent years have faced a profound jump in value. \n# For instance, 2020 had a significant increase, which could be explained by changes in property characteristics or external economic factors.\nprint(\"Property Prices by Year:\", property_prices_by_year(df))\nprint('')\n\n#Insight 3: We can observe a moderate positive correlation between assessed value and sale amount of properties of approximately 0.45. \n# This means, that properties with higher asset value led to sales for higher prices. While the correlation is overall positive, it is not perfect, \n# meaning that other factors could influence the establishment of sale prices. \nprint(\"Assessed vs Sale Price Correlation:\", assessed_vs_sale_correlation(df))\nprint('')\n\n#Insight 4: We can see that apartments stand out as the most expensive property type. \n#This can happen due to the separation of buildings into units and the generation of rental income or locations that are in high demand. \n#Likewise, commercial and industrial properties are the next most expensive types due to the high demand for office buildings, factories and warehouses. \n#Those types of properties attract high investments from bigger corporations intending to get a high return on investment. \n#Following that, we have vacant lands that are significantly lower, yet good in value due to the potential of area growth and development. \n#Lastly, we have public utilities and residential properties. Residential properties including condos, single-family parcels or townhouses, \n#can be lower in price compared to commercial properties due to slow return on investment and high supply of similar properties in one area. \n#All this can establish the lower value for residential complexes. On the other hand, public utilities, such as power stations, \n#are controlled by the governments and may have lower fixed pricing.\nprint(\"Property Type Prices:\", property_type_prices(df))\nprint('')\n\n\n#Insight 5: At this stage, we can see that the top towns with the highest transactions are Bridgeport, Stamford and Waterbury. \n#This can be due to larger populations or more active real estate markets in these areas. For realtors or investors, focusing on these towns could provide opportunities, \n#as the high volume of transactions might indicate robust market dynamics.\nprint(\"Top Transaction Towns:\", top_transaction_towns(df))\nprint('')\n\n#Insight 6: The top towns by price result is a snapshot of the most expensive towns in the United States. \n#We can note that Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan are listed as the most expensive towns, evaluated by average prices on properties for the given period, \n#ranging from 1.5M to 2M USD. This can be explained by the concentration of luxury housing, better infrastructure, school quality, \n#and overall high standard of living that determine the property pricing for these towns. For investors, understanding the potential buyers and pricing dynamic can suggest \n#a high return on investments. For buyers, this snapshot could suggest further analysis of the areas, negotiation plans and investment decisions. \nprint('Top N towns by price:', top_n_towns_by_price(df))",
